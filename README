NOTES: 
	* This project was built using rails version 3.0.0 and Ruby 1.8.7. For best results, 
		these versions should be used.
	* The precise manner in which the Survey Engine pages display is not uniform across
		all web browsers. Optimal viewing seems to be in Mozilla Firefox, some browsers
		seem to make the font sizes too small.


TO RUN LOCALLY:

	* From a command line terminal, navigate to the Survey directory for the project
	* enter the command ' rails s ' in the terminal 
	* using the web browser of your preference navigate to "localhost:3000" from your address bar
	

MOVING AROUND THE WEBSITE:
	* The root page contains the link "Survey Administrator" which leads to pages which
		allow a user to add/edit/remove both surveys and questions to a survey.
	* The link "Survey Taking" leads to a page that lists all the surveys and 
		allows a user to take a survey
	* The link "Survey Results" lists all surveys and allows a user to view the 
		responses for each survey so far.
